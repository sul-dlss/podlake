# The ordering is the whole reason this is one script rather than separate cron
# entries. `sync-all` applies each POD resource in its own transaction, so a
# reader never sees a torn write — but it can absolutely see a lake where one
# institution's latest dump has landed and another's has not. Every headline
# figure on the dashboard compares institutions to each other, so publishing from
# a part-way-synced lake produces numbers that are wrong in a way that looks
# entirely plausible. Hence one script, `set -e`, and a failed sync publishing
# nothing: stale beats half-synced. A time gap between two cron entries could not
# express the ordering either, since a sync with months of catch-up to do runs
# for hours.

# point is to say so early — and because the failure it replaces is a bad one.
